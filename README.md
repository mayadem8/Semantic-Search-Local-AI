Local Semantic Search for Processes & Steps

This project is a semantic search engine for processes and their steps using:

FAISS for vector search

Sentence Transformers for generating embeddings

Supabase as the database

FastAPI as the backend API

React as the frontend

It enables searching processes and their steps semantically (beyond keyword matching), returning the most relevant results along with optional step context.
